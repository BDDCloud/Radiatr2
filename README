This is a simple hudson build monitor using greasemonkey on Firefox. 

To use :

Download these files and install the javascript file into greasemonkey plugin for firefox.
After installation just edit the test-page.html to point to your hudson build machine with builds you are interested in. Load this page into Firefox and voila you are ready to go.

Your html should be formatted as follows:

<html>
	<link rel="stylesheet" rev="stylesheet" href="radiatr.css" media="screen">
	<head><title>Hudson Radiatr</title></head>
	<body>
		<div id="statuses">

			<div id="[build id]" class="status hudson">
				<a class="subject" href="[build url]">[build name]</a>
				<br/>
				<span class="statusInWords"></span>
				<span class="healthScore"></span><br/>
				<span class="changeSetComment"></span><br />
				<span class="claim"></span>
			</div>
		
		</div>
	</body>
</html>
